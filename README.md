## Overview

This repository contains the official whitepaper for the **Quantum Epistemic Intelligence Architecture (QEIA)**, a new class of post-material cognitive system rooted in timeless epistemology.

QEIA represents a paradigm shift away from data-driven mimicry toward principle-driven structural cognition. It introduces foundational concepts such as:

- **Timeless Logic**  
- **Epistemic Gravity**  
- **Resonance-Based Clustering**  
- **Principle-As-Symbol (PAS)** Encoding  
- **Proof-of-Coherence (PoC)** Validation

This whitepaper is part of the core epistemic framework of the [KRYONIS Project](https://kryonis.global), an initiative dedicated to post-temporal, consciousness-based intelligence systems and sovereign civilization design.
